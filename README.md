## My process

The development of the code was quite clear from the beginning but was hindered by my persistence in trying to modify the color of the cursor and not accepting the reality that I should look for an image similar to the one shown. :)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned about cursors, how to modify them, the different types and the limitations I can have if I want to modify them. 


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.flaticon.es/icono-gratis/cursor-de-mano_5781771?term=cursor+de+mano&page=1&position=12&origin=tag&related_id=5781771) - From this page I got the image of the cursor that I then modified with paint :)
